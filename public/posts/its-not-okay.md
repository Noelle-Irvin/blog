## Seed Idea
Counseling session on Friday, 03/06/2020. Talked about the snowboarding day. We reconciled and acknowledged Noelle feeling left. When it came my turn to grant forgiveness to Noelle for what I was hurt by, my response was "it's okay". Alice's immediate response was an emphatic (for her), "But it's not okay!"
