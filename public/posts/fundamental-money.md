I was 21 years old when I started my first full time job. All of the sudden, I went from almost zero financial responsibility to being responsible for managing a steady income. On top of that, I had these sticky things called student loans. I hadn't given much thought about what to do with those loans, or the paychecks when they started rolling in. Whether I liked it or not, the time had come to manage finances. Here are a few things I've learned since I was given my first paycheck.

### 1: The Power of Compound Interest
When asked to name the greatest invention in human history, Albert Einstein replied simply, "compound interest". What this really means is, if we took some number of dollars, and had it grow by a fixed percentage each year, then the resulting growth curve is exponential. That just means that the rate of growth, not just the original amount, is increasing over time. This math makes for incredibly large increases in value, especially over longer time periods.

Consider this scenario:
You save $150 per month, for 15 years. At a 6% rate of return (I'll explain this number in a bit) you end up with $44,410. That's huge! You've only actually saved $27,000, but end up with more than $17,400 from interest!

Now, what if you saved even more?
You save $500 per month, for 15 years. At a 6% rate of return you end up with $148,035! This time you've only actually saved $90,000, and have more than $58,000 from interest!

#### Action Item 1: 
Alright, so compound interest is crazy. If your interest rate was even higher, say 8%, your money would double in value every 9 years. You should take advantage of this power. The earlier the better. How, you might ask? Incredibly short answer is a low cost, diversified investment in the stock market. The stock market is the most powerful long term builder of wealth that exists, because it provides you access to the greatest invention in human history, compound interest.
At this point you might think (reasonably so), "If it's this easy why isn't everybody wealthy?" You're a savvy thinker.

### 2: This Power is Constantly Used Against You
The market, especially banks, and other businesses, understand this power and they will do their best to use it against you. The thing is, they're sneaky. You want to purchase a new car for $20,000? We'll loan you that money at only a low cost of $300 per month over 60 months! Don't pay any attention to the extra $2,000 (10% of the entire value) this will cost you over the lifetime of the loan. You can't quite afford a new laptop or a new phone? No problem! You can put those purchases on your credit card, and you'll only need to make a minimum payment of $50! That's basically free money! Pay no mind to the 20%+ interest rate that will exponentially increase the amount that you owe us over time. Here's one last example:

Let's say you have $27,000 in student loans (this is very near what I graduated with). Remember that 6% I mentioned earlier? That's almost exactly what the interest rate on my student loans was. Assuming this 6% interest rate, to pay off the principal the minimum payment is $246.70 each month for 15 years. Hopefully, you're pausing right now. "Wait, that's the same balance we referred to in the first compound interest example, but now it costs $246.70, not $150. What gives?" Exactly! Remember that extra $17,400? That's now money you owe, because of the power of compound interest.

Every single time they can, somebody is going to try and loan you money. It's in their best interest. They're smart. They're trying to leverage the power of compound interest. This is how you can make an honest living but still never build wealth. This is how people are kept down. This is why you can get a good raise and again feel like you don't make enough. Anybody who can is going to try and let you borrow, and it's always going to be framed in a positive light. Don't buy the snake oil. I honestly can't emphasize this point enough. Even if you don't decide to invest and make compound interest work for you, you must make sure it's not working against you.

#### Action Item 2: 
Be smarter than them. There are times where you will absolutely need to borrow money. Those times should be few and far between, and should usually be restricted to incredibly large purchases, like a house (there are nuances to this claim, which I acknowledge, but won't explore in detail here). Plan ahead. Save in advance to purchase vehicles and pay cash if you can. Borrowed money is called debt. Debt is the single most powerful tool that keeps you from growing wealth, regardless of how high your income is, because it's the power of compound interest working against you.

All right, maybe you're convinced that the logic is sound so far. However, a reasonable question now would be, "how do you do actually accomplish these action items?"

### 3: Live on (Much) Less than You Earn
This knowledge of compound interest, how you can use it (the stock market) and how you can be held captive by it (debt), only matters if you have money left over after your cost of living is covered. The difference between your total income and your cost of living we can refer to as your "coffee" (gravy seems cliché, and I particularly enjoy coffee). Coffee is your ticket to financial freedom. Coffee pays off debt and builds wealth. The most consistent way to ensure that you have coffee isn't to make a lot of money (though this can help). There are many people who make incredible amounts of money and never have coffee. The secret is this: spend less than you earn.

Let's consider one of the great figures in literature of our time, Mr. Krabs. Did he have a healthy surplus of money because he had an incredibly high income, or was he simply thrifty with what he earned? Admittedly, the question is challenging to answer given his non-existence and the lack of necessary detail, but it highlights a key idea. When looking at your income you should ask yourself, "How much of this do I really need in order to sustain myself?" In nearly every situation (acknowledging the outliers), your total income should exceed the answer to that question. However, this takes discipline. This might mean living with a roommate if you're single and live in an expensive area. This might mean only eating out once a week. This certainly means telling yourself "no" sometimes. Saying no is a powerful way to personally grow in self discipline. Doing so, you have much more control over how much you spend than how much you earn. You should use it. How?

You need a budget. An entirely true statement, and I know you've heard it before. It's amazing how easy it is to just swipe a card for lunch or a coffee or new shoes here and there and end up spending an extra several hundred dollars each month on unplanned expenses. I know that for many of us budget feels like a bad word, because it implies a restriction of freedom, but it turns out that your budget isn't the fun police. Here's a perspective you might not have considered. The purpose of a budget is not to restrict your spending, it's to enable it. Do you want to be able to spend more money on things you love doing? Budget. Do you want to be able to travel around the country for a month with a friend? Budget. Do you want to be able to buy a new (gently used, if you're wise) car? Budget. The only way to have money to spend on things that you really value is by not spending money on things that you don't really value.

I'd also like to offer a definition of budget that isn't "spreadsheet". The definition is this, "a conscious choice about how you spend each and every dollar you earn." Making a decision about where every single dollar you make goes is one of the most important concepts in money management. It helps you have coffee, and coffee empowers you to spend money on things you value, give generously, and save appropriately.

#### The Nutshell
Money can be oppressive, regardless of how much you earn, if you aren't careful. You can avoid being held hostage by finances if you make compound interest work for you, not against you. How? Spend less than you earn. Think carefully and make decisions about what happens with every penny of your income. Pay off debt quickly and save a (healthy) portion of every paycheck. Being a little wise with money enables you to be generous, spend well, and save effectively.
If I was to tweet myself at the cusp of my working life, it might look like this.
Spend a little time thinking about money, because financial freedom is priceless.

Epilogue
I think it is worth noting the goal of these thoughts, shared in this manner. The desire is to convey what I have seen to be the most essential concepts in basic money management, and how significant an impact these concepts can have on one's life. It would be a success if a reader found themself thinking, "There is good reason to check these action items off my list", if they have not already. Here I hope to answer why think about money, but merely point the reader at how.
