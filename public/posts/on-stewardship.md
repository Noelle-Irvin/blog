### The Problem of Stewardship
I've [written before about money](https://thisgoodendeavor.com/fundamental-money). The purpose of that post could be summarized, "To communicate, in a nutshell, how to maximize personal wealth." While this is an incredibly pragmatic goal, it is, I think, incomplete. Actually, it would be more correct of me to say not that it is incomplete, rather it is but one part of a greater whole. 

We live in an age where, for the majority of the population (in first world countries), the primary objective of living is not _merely_ survival. What this means in financial terms is that most individuals earn more money than is sufficient to provide for themselves food, shelter, and clothing. Which presents an obvious question, "How should they use the surplus?"

As a Christian, I think this question gets much more interesting to consider. The Bible gives us more than two _thousand_ verses on the subject of money. A fact often referenced on Sunday morning, if a pastor is feeling bold enough to preach truthfully on the subject. Yet, how much does the average Christian actually know about the biblical Truth of financial stewardship? How often in your closest Christian friendships do you broach the subject? Despite being perhaps the most universal responsibility of a Christian (but for the great commission, and to walk humbly with our God), it remains one of the most taboo topics of conversation. There are few more practical subjects to learn for a Christian, and few so infrequently discussed.

Before delving into the truth of biblical stewardship, I want to answer the question, "Why?" Why does it really matter how I, as an ambassador for Christ, use the money in my possession? Why do I need to think deeply into this subject, and pursue the biblical Truth? A good friend of mine asked me the same just a few days ago, and before all else, it deserves a good and thorough answer.

### Why Do I Care?
I would assert two reasons for this subject's paramount importance in the life of a Christian. First, a Christian's attitude towards (and use of) money is a _wildly_ effective aspect of his or her witness. American culture, and the culture of the world, views money chiefly as a means for acquisition of power, self-importance, and material possessions. It is considered normal (and ethically permissed) to use the overwhelming majority of money you earn for your own desires and means. 

A biblically-founded perspective on money is so antithetical to the world's, that it perplexes the average person to see a Christian using money the way God intends us to. There are few more powerful ways to share the character of God than by allowing others to observe your biblical use of money (caveat, only if the _reason_ for allowing others to observe is not to [bolster your own self-righteousness](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-3.htm)). 

How better create opportunities for meaningful conversation about the ways in which God has changed your heart, than to counter the culture when it comes to money? When you demonstrate by your actions that money has no hold on your heart (in the way it does for most), you create tremendous space in peoples' hearts and minds for hearing _why_ it has no hold (and therefore, hearing the Gospel). So, first, to know and live biblical stewardship is a wonderful aid in the Christian's endeavor to share Christ. 

Second, acting out biblical stewardship ensures (repeatedly) you are not subconsciously worshipping a counterfeit god. There are many places a man or woman can seek a sense of identity, value, and security. Romantic relationships are one. Professional success is another. Chief among these is the accrual of money. By accumulating wealth, an individual can find a sense of accomplishment, pride, safety, and self-worth. For a Christian this is subtly, but incredibly, dangerous. To allow any one thing to take God's place as your providence, security, and identity is perhaps the most sinister of evils. 

This is what the bible calls an idol. Something or someone that assumes a role which ought to be filled by God in your life. Do you derive a greater sense of security from your net worth than from knowing God's sovereignty, power, and goodness? Do you derive your self-worth more from your financial status than from Christ calling you, by name, into a relationship with himself? 

The simplest way to reveal the answers to these questions is to look at your use of money. Is it difficult to think about giving a full tithe? Do you budget more for luxuries and comfort than for serving the lost and least? Hunting down and slaying idols is a difficult, but crucial, task in a Christian's life. Understanding the truth of biblical stewardship can aid you much in this effort, and lead you to a more honest and more intimate relationship with God. 

## The Truth of Stewardship
all good things come from God
- our talents, money, relationships, and things are all given to us

to be a steward
- if we are merely managers, then the responsibility of stewardship is not to give God his piece and then take ours, it's to responsibly manage _all_ things our master has trusted us with
- to think you can give your tithes and offerings, and then have fulfilled the responsibility of stewardship is wrong
