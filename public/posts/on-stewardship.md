### The Problem of Stewardship
I've [written before about money](https://thisgoodendeavor.com/fundamental-money). The purpose of that post could be summarized, "To communicate, in a nutshell, how to maximize personal wealth." While this is an incredibly pragmatic goal, it is, I think, incomplete. Actually, it would be more correct of me to say not that it is incomplete, rather it is but one part of a greater whole. 

We live in an age where, for the majority of the population (in first world countries), the primary objective of living is not _merely_ survival. What this means in financial terms is that most individuals earn more money than is sufficient to provide for themselves food, shelter, and clothing. Which presents an obvious question, "How should they use the surplus?"

As a Christian, I think this question gets much more interesting to consider. The Bible gives us more than two _thousand_ verses on the subject of money. A fact often referenced on Sunday morning, if a pastor is feeling bold enough to preach truthfully on the subject. Yet, how much does the average Christian actually know about the biblical Truth of financial stewardship? How often in your closest Christian friendships do you broach the subject? Despite being perhaps the most universal responsibility of a Christian (but for the great commission, and to walk humbly with our God), it remains one of the most taboo topics of conversation. There are few more practical subjects to learn for a Christian, and few so infrequently discussed.

Before delving into the truth of biblical stewardship, I want to answer the question, "Why?" Why does it really matter how I, as an ambassador for Christ, use the money in my possession? Why do I need to think deeply into this subject, and pursue the biblical Truth? A good friend of mine asked me the same just a few days ago, and before all else, it deserves a good and thorough answer.

### Why Do I Care?
I would assert two reasons for this subject's paramount importance in the life of a Christian. First, a Christian's attitude towards (and use of) money is a _wildly_ effective aspect of his or her witness. American culture, and the culture of the world, views money chiefly as a means for acquisition of power, pride, and possessions. It is considered normal (and ethically permissed) to use the overwhelming majority of money you earn for your own desires and means. 

A biblically-founded perspective on money is so antithetical to the world's, that it perplexes the average person to see a Christian using money the way God intends us to. There are few more powerful ways to share the character of God than by allowing others to observe your biblical use of money (if the _reason_ for allowing others to observe is not to [bolster your own self-righteousness](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-3.htm)). 

How better create opportunities for meaningful conversation about the ways in which God has changed your heart, than to counter the culture when it comes to money? When you demonstrate by your actions that money has no hold on your heart (in the way it does for most), you create tremendous space in peoples' hearts and minds for hearing _why_ it has no hold (and therefore, hearing the Gospel). So, first, to know and live biblical stewardship is a wonderful aid in the Christian's endeavor to share Christ. 

Second, acting out biblical stewardship ensures (repeatedly) you are not subconsciously worshipping a counterfeit god. There are many places a man or woman can seek a sense of identity, value, and security. Romantic relationships are one. Professional success is another. Chief among these is the accrual of money. By accumulating wealth, an individual can find a sense of accomplishment, pride, security, and self-worth. For a Christian this is subtly, but incredibly, dangerous. To allow anything to take God's place as your providence, security, and identity is perhaps the most insidious of evils. 

This is what the bible calls an idol. Something or someone that assumes a role in your life which ought to be filled by God. Do you garner a greater sense of security from your net worth than from knowing God's sovereignty, power, and goodness? Do you derive your self-worth more from your socioeconomic status than from Christ calling you, by name, into a relationship with himself? 

The simplest way to reveal the answers to these questions is to look at your use of money ([Matthew 6:21](https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm)). Is it difficult to think about giving a full tithe? Do you budget more for luxuries and comfort than for serving the lost and least? Hunting down and slaying idols is a difficult, but crucial, task in a Christian's life. Understanding the truth of biblical stewardship can aid you much in this effort, and lead you to a more honest and more intimate relationship with God. 

## The Truth of Stewardship
If you think back to grade school, you probably remember the little social ecosystem that existed. There were the different cliques, the popular kids, the athletes, the nerds, etc. These groups were roughly ordered in some sort of hierarchy, each afforded some social status according to their ranking. Ironically, as an adult, not much changes. Except now the hierarchy is more closely attached to how much money you make. In both cases, the underlying assumption is that, because you have more of a thing than someone else (talent, beauty, achievement), you have _earned_ the social status you're afforded. This assumption still underlies much of our thinking today. If you make more money than someone else, you're likely to implicitly consider yourself superior to them, without even specifically thinking about it. Conversely, if you make less, you're likely to feel inferior, compelled to compensate for your difference in economic status by asserting some other form of superiority (e.g. moral). 

The biblical truth, however, is a stark contrast. The bible says that we, as individuals, haven't done anything to earn what we have ([James 1:17](https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm)). It's easy to accept this truth for things like beauty, talent, and intelligence, because those are traits we are born with. It's harder to accept this truth when we think about what we've done with those gifts. "I worked hard to get where I am!" My question for folks who make that assertion would be, where did your work ethic come from? Who gave you the discipline you used to study and practice so diligently? Ultimately, you were knitted together in the womb by your Creator. We have no claim to every good and perfect gift He's given us, even to life itself.

So, if all good things are ultimately given to us by God, what does that make us? Stewards. To steward means to ["manage or look after (another's property)"](https://www.google.com/search?q=steward). God's trusted us with the responsibility of managing the gifts he's given. These gifts are inclusive of, but not limited to, money. Furthermore, if the money in the paycheck we receive is not ours, but His, then our responsibility is not simply to give God his portion (through charitable giving, or the like), but to honor God with every penny. 

Herein lies the chief challenge of the Christian, when it comes to money. How do they honor God with every penny of the money he's entrusted them?

## Give, Save, Spend
- three things you can do with money, give, save, spend
- giving - talked about the most, but often in unhelpful ways. the question isn't "what's the least I can give with which God would be satisfied?", but is "how do I honor God with my giving?" having relationships with the recipients. giving in ways that actually help honor God's design for people as image-bearers. 
- saving - parable of the talents. we ought to multiply what we've been given. story of Joseph, storing up for the 7yr famine
- spending - David, a man after God's own heart, was a king, and clearly wasn't living an ascetic lifestyle.
