## "You can do it. We can help."
When I graduated college at 21 (it's already been four years?) I accepted a job offer with The Home Depot as a Software Engineer. I spent the early days of my time there writing code with a Senior Software Engineer by the name of Don. Don, in an endearing way, was a crotchety old man. He was kind (though sometimes non-obviously), and went out of his way to introduce me to his vast network of coworkers within THD. He also spent a lot of time helping me learn my way around life as an adult. How do I open a new bank account? How should I manage a budget? What should I do for my honeymoon? Don was great, and I miss Don.

The team I worked on consisted of a few other folks; another senior engineer, a quality engineer, and a user experience designer. Over the course of the first year, we developed a web application to help manage and track the $10b in inventory that was passed around between distribution centers and stores each year. For the first six months of that year, I really loved the work. Each day I became measurably more knowledgable and skillful as an engineer, and it was incredibly gratifying. It did become apparent though, as I neared the end of my first year, aspects of the work environment were particularly painful for me. There wasn't an even distribution of responsibility among the team. I was disproportionately responsible for the software being delivered (during the week I was away for my honeymoon, nothing was accomplished), and it was incredibly frustrating to me that each team member's  recognition or compensation wasn't directly a function of their merit.

I wrote about this in some more detail in my [post about my first two years as a software engineer](https://thisgoodendeavor.com/what-i-learned-in-my-first-two-years), but there are a couple more aspects of this experience I want to explore. First, what was it that I _really_ desired to be true of my work environment? Second, how did I (if at all) end up in a role which possessed those qualities?

### The Dream Job
You know, I actually am feeling some amount of self-loathing for the title of this section. I don't think a "dream" job, or "dream" anything, exists. We live in a world corrupted by sin, and are a broken people. In such a world, I don't think it's possible for a "dream" anything to exist. At least, if we define dream as, "characterized by perfect fulfillment and joy". Any work, any marriage, any hobby, or any entertainment are going to be incomplete in their ability to provide joy and satisfaction, given the human condition. So, when I title this section "The Dream Job", what I really intend to communicate is, "a role which is as satisfying and joyful an experience as can be had, in the presence of our fallen nature."

While I was still at The Home Depot, I thought deeply into what it was that was greatly unsatisfying about the current role. It was more helpful to frame the internal dialogue (and later, this and other external dialogues) in the context of, "What traits would make a role truly satisfying (acknowledging that no role is perfect)?" In that vein, it was easy to take the aspect of my role at The Home Depot with which I was most frustrated, and reverse engineer what I was really looking for.

#### A Meritocracy
I want the level of responsibility, recognition, compensation, and respect in my workplace to be a function _almost_ solely of an individual's merit (the _almost_ is crucial here, and I'll revisit it soon). I want to be led by folks who are talented at the leadership of people. I want to be instructed in engineering disciplines by someone who is more skilled in them than I. I want to work alongside individuals who achieved their current role, and are earning their title every day. I want to look around and think, "each person I work with has a skill or trait which I greatly admire, and would like to emulate in my own work." 

But, the "almost". All of this does not contradict the fact my coworkers are human. I don't expect perfection by any means. I, and my coworkers, will make mistakes (frequently). There should, and will be, grace for those mistakes. We should help compensate for each others' weaknesses, and not be harbor judgement if someone is less skilled in a given area than we are. However, I do expect all of us to be striving for excellence, together. I do expect all of us to be pulling our weight each week, knowing that some weeks will be heavier than others, and that in some seasons we'll pull a disproportionate amount of weight in order to help each other along. All said, I want merit (how much value a person contributes to the team/company) to be held in high regard, and I want evidence of this belief to be apparent in each individual's responsibility, recognition, compensation, and respect. This desire is a pretty strong opinion, I've found, and it would be very difficult to work in an environment where this desire (among others) isn't shared.

#### A Kindred Spirit
I want both my desire for meritocracy, and the pursuit of excellence in each person's craft, to be shared by my coworkers. We are to serve our work as if for God, and not for people. Therefore, I desire to be the best I can be in my discipline. I desire to be the best teammate I can be by strengthening relationships, loving my teammates, and delivering the best possible quality software. I want to reflect God's character of wisdom, knowledge, and grace through the way I interact with my coworkers, and through the code I write. I don't expect all of my coworkers to share the same _why_, but I greatly desire they would share this pursuit of excellence (both in technical skill, and interpersonal skill). It's difficult to pursue this kind of ability without somebody who is farther along the road. Somebody who can help you grow much faster than you could on your own.

#### Mentorship
At The Home Depot, there wasn't a more senior engineer to me who was willing, or able, to help me grow in my technical skills. I greatly
