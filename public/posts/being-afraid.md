## On Counseling
I think this post would be best prefaced by a short contemplation of counseling (or psychotherapy), and its relatively newfound role in society, and recently my marriage. In one of my wife and I's favorite shows to watch together, "The Office" (US)", there are two characters, Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly. They share a whimsical friendship over the first few seasons, with a distinct flavor of romantic interest. Somewhere around season 7 or season 8 of the show, we find them now married, and with a few children. Jim is pursuing a new, uncertain, job in a different city, creating stress and pressure on their relationship. At one point, Jim walks over to Toby (divorced since the beginning of the show), and asks something like "Did you and your ex-wife ever attend couples counseling?" Toby responds, alarmed, with something to the effect of "Wait, you and Pam aren't in couples counseling, are you?!" 

The implication in Toby's alarm is not hard to deduce. If you're in couples counseling, then your relationship must be on the rocks, so to speak. This perception, while not universal, I've found quite common, and even within my past self. Thinking back on the stories I would hear about people, or couples, in counseling, they were always told with an air of sadness or pity. "Those people must be really messed up to go pay somebody to listen to their problems for an hour a week," I thought. The irony is not lost on me, now.

However, it's exactly this perception that I challenge. Consider, if you see somebody with a personal trainer working out hard at the gym, what do you think? I'd imagine a line similar to, "Good for them. They're taking care of themselves." When you hear somebody is going to see a counselor or therapist, why shouldn't the same thought be true? In the same way that you must work and put your body through pain in order to maintain good physical shape, the care of your emotional and mental state requires time, effort, and often pain (working out hurts, in the short term). Good mental and emotional health comes with work, and the subject, in my opinion, is more difficult to spelunk on your own than that of physical fitness. Which, in my wife and I's case, has led us to visit a counselor near our home together, every other week. 

## Prior Sessions
The Thursday prior was the fourth such time Noelle and I sat down (this time, virtually) with our counselor. Each of the first three sessions I had intended to reflect on, in writing, with more detail. However, for the purposes of this post, a more succinct summary must suffice. 

The first session, in a word, was uncomfortable. Noelle and I spent the majority of the time talking through our present difficulties in communicating with and understanding the other. For my part, I had a tendency to hoard time alone, and to make myself non-dependent on people and things, which stymied Noelle's understanding to no end. I went on to think through this tendency, and observed how I would often approach panic, if I believed I would not get enough time alone. I also spent a good portion of time describing my childhood, which I've always remembered fondly. As I shared, Alice (our counselor), commented something like, "It sounds like you believe that you're only going to receive care from yourself. If that is true, it certainly makes sense why you would start to panic if you think that care won't come, because the time alone might not be coming." At the time, I thought it was a good insight. I think of my alone time as my way of caring for myself. If I think it's not coming, I get spooked. Anyhow, the truly uncomfortable part was when Alice asked me to turn to Noelle and share how I felt when I thought I wouldn't receive this care, from myself or others. After a few false starts, she finally coaxed out something like, "Vulnerable, scared." Man, I don't think I'd felt so uncomfortable since the episode of "The Office" where Michael outed Oscar and then tried to resolve the problem in the conference room. She asked me to share this feeling with Noelle (yikes), and then for Noelle to respond to that feeling (yikes).

It's even uncomfortable to write about. 

The sessions after followed a similar pattern. Noelle and I would share either a recent conflict or what we'd been experiencing generally in the two weeks past, and Alice would unpack each emotion from the experiences, in order, and ask us to share them with each other, and then respond. The purpose, I believe, was to give each emotion space to heal by sharing it, and allowing the other to empathize. Boy, do I not enjoy that process. The first few sessions, I found myself without even a proper vocabulary for the relevant emotions. It's improved since, if only slightly. In some of the sessions, we spent more time exploring my tendency for self-care, and my hesitation to vulnerability. I don't think anything became exceptionally clear for me, however, until last Thursday.

## Reconciling Conflicts
Which leads us to our most recent time spent with Alice. Noelle and I, the prior week, had experienced a bit of a culmination of some strong emotions on each of our parts. It started Thursday evening, with my approaching Noelle, seeking reconciliation. She was clearly upset, and though I was experiencing similar emotions, I asked her what she was feeling and patiently listened. For an hour or so, she described how she was upset with my tendency to not consider doing things together (like eating meals). She felt forgotten, and not thought-of. It was painful to hear, and there was truth in her angry words. In the moment, though, I desired not to absorb and reconcile her words, but to retaliate. In itself, that desire is revealing, but let's put a pin in it. In what I legitimately can only credit to the presence of the Spirit, I absorbed her words and her hurt with tenderness and patience, and we were reconciled to great intimacy.

The next morning, I woke up, very much grateful for the reconciliation of the previous night, but with something still not quite right. We enjoyed a shared breakfast early, good humor throughout the day, and a longer walk through the park in the afternoon. By the evening, however, I found myself bubbling up with the frustrations I had yet to share. By dinner, I was entirely silent, and Noelle knew something wasn't right. After we ate, my feelings finally made themselves known. I raised my voice, not for the first time, but one of the very few in our four plus years together. I gesticulated somewhat dramatically, and in the end I was panting and staring at my wife, waiting for her response. I have a humorous image in my head of myself frothing at the mouth and bulging at the eyes, though I don't believe that is what she saw. She wore a ghost of a smile, and slowly said, "I understand why you feel that way." I balked at the anticlimax. _That's it?_, I thought. My emotions were healed, and we were truly reconciled.

After sharing this with Alice, we explored one of the more interesting parts of the story. Why didn't I share my emotions the night before? Why did I wait until the following day, and even then, only share them when they would no longer be contained? Here lies the rub.

## Why?
There is a good argument to be made that my wife was not in a good place to hear what I had to share on Thursday evening, and that it was wise to wait until a later time to speak. I made this argument during our time with Alice. I still believe its merit. Yet, it is not the entire truth. If that was entirely true, why wait the entire day following before sharing? Why not share the next morning after breakfast? The truth here, is that I didn't plan on sharing. In my head, I expected to be able to go off to a quiet place, resolve these feelings on my own (perhaps during prayer, perhaps while simply alone), and then return to my wife. This pattern, I now recognize, is paramount to my strategy for moving through the world. I quite enjoy helping care for others, and gladly care for my wife, but when it comes my turn, I retreat to a quiet place to care for myself.
